# Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection: A Progressive Approach to Health Management

## Project Description
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition that can be managed or cured if detected early. Routine medical tests contain valuable information that can help in early detection. This project leverages **machine learning** to analyze such test results and predict the likelihood of CKD, supporting timely intervention and better health outcomes.

This project is part of an internship at **SmartInternz**.

## Real-World Scenarios
- **Early Detection through Routine Tests:** Abnormal creatinine and albumin levels in routine check-ups help detect CKD early, enabling timely treatment.  
- **Predicting Disease Severity and Survival:** Hospitals can analyze patient data with AI to predict disease severity and survival outcomes, supporting targeted treatments.  
- **Monitoring Disease Progression:** The system tracks key biomarkers over time, alerting physicians to worsening patterns for proactive care.  

## Project Structure
Flask/ # Flask web app for CKD prediction
Training/ # Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training
dataset/ # CKD dataset
test_ckd.py # Automated test script for the Flask app

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.  
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
